## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions

- Can we rust? https://hackmd.io/SBZ5vrLQRrOOlUog2tZ_9Q

    Lots of followup discussion on this. Some people were even interested in exploring using Rust *instead of C++*. Some discussion about proc macros and Rust generics vs C++ templates.

- Thoughts on allocating a larger object to speed up scalar (and maybe small array creation)? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29878

## New topics

Joren asked to have some opinions on some minor PRs that have API impacts.
    * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30000
    * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30007
    

Maanas asked about converting the really big .c.src templates like arraytypes.c.src.
