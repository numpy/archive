## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions



## New topics

- We may want to shift the time slot again (at least when Europe shifts time zones, which is in April).

- Sayed work plan for NumPy.
  - Idea for getting more math kernels/moving svml:
    - subrepository for working on these
    - Use highway (mostly?)
    - Do not work within highwigh (churn, python tests, FPE needs that might not quite match.)
