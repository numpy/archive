## Follow-up from previous meetings / discussions

- Can we rust? https://hackmd.io/SBZ5vrLQRrOOlUog2tZ_9Q
Lots of followup discussion on this. Some people were even interested in exploring using Rust *instead of C++*. Some discussion about proc macros and Rust generics vs C++ templates.

- Thoughts on allocating a larger object to speed up scalar (and maybe small array creation)? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29878
    
## New topics
- Reviewing AI-generated PRs
  - We could add Copilot instructions similar to this doc authored by Joren: https://github.com/jorenham/xsf-rust/blob/master/.github/copilot-instructions.md
  - Discussion on the Scientific Python Discord: https://discuss.scientific-python.org/t/a-policy-on-generative-ai-assisted-contributions/1702/21
