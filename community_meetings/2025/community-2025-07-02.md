## Follow-up from the last meeting / discussions


## New topics

- Is windows_arm64 github action running? Should it be?
  - We need to delete the yaml file and delete the [workflows](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/actions/workflows/windows_arm64.yml)

- floating point problems in OpenBLAS builds on mac:
  - Trying with `/clang:-ftrapping-math` may be an option, since either can definitely cause this type of issues.

- Doxygen follow up from [here](https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/main/docs_team_meetings/2025/docs-2025-02-10.md#follow-up-from-last-meeting--discussions)
  - breathe (used in the conversion of doxygen output to RST) is being maintained, and the latest version has cleaned up problems with later versions of sphinx.
  - Is it a priority to move documentation into the code? Not clear. We could ask for a small development grant from NumFOCUS to help fund someone to do it, but we would need a core developer to help mentor the project.

- Documentation Team meeting: is it still happening? If not, we can fold documentation discussion topics into this meeting.
*Update from Mukulika via Slack:* The attendance numbers have been very low. Folding Docs Team meetings into Wed meetings makes sense.

- Next Wednesdayâ€™s triage meeting is canceled due to most regular attendees being out of office. Inessa will make the announcement.

- Short discussion about the [sort PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28516)
