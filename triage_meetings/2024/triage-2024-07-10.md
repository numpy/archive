**Present**: Sebastian, Tammy, Anne, Joren, Tyler, Ben
 
## Follow up from previous meetings 

- Chuck: should we increase the line length to 85 characters?
  - We discussed this. There was a concensus around 88 chars. There is a `.clang-format` file that can enforce this, should it replace the c style guide? 


- Array API 2023.12 update:
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26766 ready
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26889 ready for review


## New topics

- Discussing running test suite with codespaces/devspaces.

- Discussion about typing PRs.
  - Sebastian: Those PRs look good, but I am not sure if Bas did this intentionally (pinging him).  (Because this is not encouraged usage, nobody should do some of these.)

- pylance wants us to take their type stubs https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26845
