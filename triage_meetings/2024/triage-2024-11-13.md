## Follow up from previous meetings

- [name=Adrin] (hopefully this is the right place to put it). It'd be nice if I could get some insight into this issue): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26018#discussion_r1771824129
  - There is not a whole lot to discuss, we need a careful review

- Discussion about OpenBLAS threads (should we increase the threshold when threads are used)?
  - We should write a FAQ

- Endorsing SPECs 1, 6, 7, 8
SPEC 1 — Lazy Loading of Submodules and Functions (https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0001)
SPEC 6 — Keys to the Castle (https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0006)
SPEC 7 — Seeding Pseudo-Random Number Generation (https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0007)
SPEC 8 — Securing the Release Process (https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0008)
  - Action item: open PRs in https://github.com/scientific-python/specs and ask for three steering council members to give a thumbs-up endorsment.

## New topics

- [name=mtsokol] I think it's ready: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27735
- [name=mtsokol] `__module__` items to clean-up: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27716 (related comment: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/136559#issuecomment-2372364658)
- [name=sayed] loongarch: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27662
  - If we accept this PR which uses Universal Intrinsics, we will make it harder to move to Highway which does not support loongarch. The PR does have CI with QEMU support, which was the minimum request. It seems Highway has no immediate plans to support loongarch.


## Action items
