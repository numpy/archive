## Follow up from previous meetings

- [name=Adrin] (hopefully this is the right place to put it). It'd be nice if I could get some insight into this issue): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/26018#discussion_r1771824129
  - There is not a whole lot to discuss, we need a careful review

- Discussion about OpenBLAS threads (should we increase the threshold when threads are used)?
  - We should write a FAQ: We can partially refer to the scikit-learn one.

- [name=sayed] loongarch: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27856
  - Still working on getting loongarch to a place that we can merge it. The CI run needs to cross compile in order to have a reasonable build time (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27856#discussion_r1861107712).

## New topics

- Opinions on the funny stack allocation (for matti)

- Looking into cleaning out buffering (reduce but not just reduce)...  The one change, I think is needed is reducing the buffer-size up to half size.
  (I think that is fine, since it is unlikely you always get buffer-size sized chunks, since it would require the array to be a multiple of that size...)
