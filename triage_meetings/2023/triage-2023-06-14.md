## Follow up from previous meetings

- Inessa: Blog post draft about 2.0 plans: https://hackmd.io/RDJypKvhRAitaO4B8B_G5w
  - Where will it be posted?
  Release notes will contain a link to the blog post on numpy.org.


- Inessa: Let's endorse SPEC 0 and SPEC 4 (https://scientific-python.org/specs/) 
  - Sebastian and Brigitta are in support.
  - (mattip) I have some reservations about the wording of the SPECs and have expressed them. I await clarifications. TL;DR: SPEC0 interaction with NEP29 is not clear. SPEC4 mixes site admin with project admin, and has some security shortcomings.
  - Decision: Matti will write to the NumPy Steering Council a summary of today's discussion.
  

## New topics

- Chuck: .pdf version of the NumPy docs will not be generated for 1.25

- Matti: ENH: datetime64: Remove deprecation warning when constructing with timezone: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/23904
Discussion:
    - Who will be affected? pandas (?)
    - Deprecation warning isn't a good name as this isn't a deprecation (no plans for it in the foreseeable future). Perhaps, name it as "user warning". 

- Nathan: take temperature about a stringdtype NEP
