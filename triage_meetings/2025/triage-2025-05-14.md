## Follow up from previous meetings

- Unique nan PR: need to read through it

- (Raghuveer) Vendored meson: path to merging it upstream and getting rid of our fork?
  - We use a feature dectection module that has not been upstreamed to meson. But the work to upstream that module is uneccesary if we are intending to use Highway's dispatch system. Using that dispatch system would mean dropping MSVC support. Are we ready for that? The general feeling was that the status quo is OK.

- NumType now has MkDocs documentation https://numpy.org/numtype/

- Deprecation of `numpy.typing.NBitBase` (https://github.com/numpy/numtype/issues/395)

- Should `np.count_nonzero` return `int` or NumPy scalar for `axis=None`?
  `int` is the current behavior and scalar is expected by Array API. New behavior would be a change to the promotion of expressions that use `count_nonzero` without axis. https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28615
  - no strong opinions, Joren thinks it is a bit more consistent to change.

- Mateusz Sokol - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28678 is ready for the final review.
  
- Work required for Windows on Arm runners? https://github.com/MacPython/openblas-libs/pull/193 / optimised https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28836

* https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/28687
    * Apple seems to think there is no good forward, because this is due to new use of vector extensions on ARM chicps.  (This should not be limited to M4, but rather the new OS).
    * They saying that with new extensions and using them, FPEs are just not going to work, so not sure what to do about that.
        * Just disable FPE checking?  But on which systems?
        * Any ideas what to ask more?

## New topics

- Any objections to using openmp in np.sort? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28619
  - unclear for now, let's ping some people.
  - Disabled by default, needs to be custom build with `-Denable-openmp=true`

- Resolution on Highway wrapper: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28622
    - multiple other PR's rely on it and are blocked
