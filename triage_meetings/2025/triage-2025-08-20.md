## Follow up from previous meetings


## New topics
- New meeting time: is the community calendar updated? Yes!
- [PR 29537](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29537) to improve np.unique for complex, float: it seems to improve somewhere around 10% for float, and 3-4x for complex!
  - Does it slow down for small arrays?
  - Copilot added some comments
  - The benchmarks should be part of our benchmark suite.
- Discuss resolution for https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/29560
- intel/x86-simd-sort will probably not be maintained by Intel going forward. Needs a new home.
- [Issue 28287](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/28287) to deprecate `generic` unit for timedelta
  - Does this deprecation make sense?
  - Do you have any concerns?
  - Who should we ping regarding this decision? (Sebastian suggests pandas members)
