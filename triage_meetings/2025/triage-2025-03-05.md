**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

**Present**: Chuck, Tyler, Matti, Raghuveer, Manaas Arora, Sayed, Sebastian, Nathan

## Follow up from previous meetings

- Matti will look into the manylinux transition eventually. Looking at [graphs of popularity of systems](https://mayeut.github.io/manylinux-timeline/), it seems it may still be too early to jump to 2_28

- Unique nan PR: need to read through it

- casting with `same_value`: Matti started a branch and wrote a [TODO](https://github.com/mattip/numpy/blob/value-based/TODO_same_value). The basic idea is to do an unsafe cast and then check and error if any value changed, so two loops over the data. Sebastian asked how this will handle iterators and ufuncs. For now the branch will ignore interators and ufuncs.


## New topics

- (Raghuveer) SIMD arg-quicksort on ASIMD uses additional O(N) space https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28416
    - is the additional space a problem? quicksort typically is constant space

- (Raghuveer) Vendored meson: path to merging it upstream and getting rid of our fork?
  - We use a feature dectection module that has not been upstreamed to meson. But the work to upstream that module is uneccesary if we are intending to use Highway's dispatch system. Using that dispatch system would mean dropping MSVC support. Are we ready for that? The general feeling was that the status quo is OK.
