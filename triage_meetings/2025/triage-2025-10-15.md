## Follow up from previous meetings

- [PR 29537](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29537) to improve np.unique for complex, float: it seems to improve somewhere around 10% for float, and 3-4x for complex!
  - Does it slow down for small arrays?
  - Copilot added some comments
  - Decided to only apply this to complex
  - PR seems ready to go?

- [Issue 28287](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/28287) and [PR 29619](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29619) to deprecate `generic` unit for timedelta. It creates a unitless NAT. We should ping some pandas people to see if this breaks anything

- Threaded test failure in the maintenance branch, probably because of OpenBLAS, there is another OpenBLAS-related issue with M4 on arm64 (when using OpenBLAS)
- Britney's internship ends next week, there is a PR to add pytest markers. We can hopefully then add a pytest-threaded CI run.

- Add Plausable analytics to the NumPy docs: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29892. Inessa will send a message to the mailing list that we've merged the PR and are planning to make the dashboards public.

- Sorting: should we expose slots for sorting or the generic sort? Discussion: we need to add descending sorts for generic functions. It would be good to expose the slots, but not make them required.


## New topics

- `inspect.signature` Support
  - `numpy.ma.core._frommethod`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30091  (merged)
  - `numpy.ufunc`: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/30095

## Action items

- Let's try to block out some time in the next meeting to go through PRs with the ENH label (there are around 100!) to try to close a bunch of them.
