## Follow up from previous meetings/discussions
- ADD GH issue or PR for the followup

- Would at least need some rules to filter very old issues, but in case someone likes it: https://numpy.triage-party.mriduls.com/s/home


## New topics

- (mattip) C++ standards: how deep into C++ features do we want to go:
  - Apparently the ship has sailed for templating, but we should try to limit their use to what we need
  - We need to capture exceptions if we are using the C++ runtime
  - We would like to try to standardize around a set of built-in dtype traits.
  - We should not go further than c++-17

- Linalg `eig` always return complex? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30411

- F2py intent inout fix: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29929
  - Two options:
    - Cast at least some dtypes if mismatch (with copy). Forgiving, but behavior changes subtly (previously a different dtype was returned).
    - Just refuse (raise error)



## Action items

- Any other pending deprecations like https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30282 ?
  -  Nope; maybe ping Pieter Eendenbak

- Let's try to block out some time in the next meeting to go through PRs with the ENH label (there are around 100!) to try to close a bunch of them.
