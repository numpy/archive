## Follow up from previous meetings/discussions

- Linalg `eig` always return complex? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30411

- F2py intent inout fix: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29929
  - Two options:
    - Cast at least some dtypes if mismatch (with copy). Forgiving, but behavior changes subtly (previously a different dtype was returned).
    - Just refuse (raise error)


## New topics

* Tyler: NumPy `2.4.0` yanking or `2.4.1` plans as they relate to SciPy `1.17.0` "final" release soon.
  * 2.4.1 should come out this weekend
  * We'll probably yank 2.4.0 after that.

* Test failure on BSD.

* Is it acceptable for `ctypeslib.as_ctypes` to no longer support scalar arrays? (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30538)
  * As part of fixing [gh-30354](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/30354), scalar arrays now expose a read-only flag via `__array_interface__`.
  * As a result, `ctypeslib.as_ctypes` raises an error for scalar arrays.
  * Sebastian: My take, let's change it to return a read-only array-interface.  But maybe not backport it.

* Joren: `chararray` deprecation
  * Should be deprecated, but is only deprecated in `np.chararray`, not `np.char.chararray`
  * Joren will deprecate it

* Revert change to `q` promotion or do: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30601 to retain the fix?
  * Does change the NaN version (i.e. old PR didn't align it fully).

* Should push for reverse sorts for 2.5 

* Create new repository for quaddtype.
  * Yes, this seems fine to do.

* Nice PR for speedup on for searchsorted https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30517 that we should look at.
  * Chuck is planning to have a look.

## Action items

- Any other pending deprecations like https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30282 ?
  -  Nope; maybe ping Pieter Eendenbak
  -  done; no response yet

- Let's try to block out some time in the next meeting to go through PRs with the ENH label (there are around 100!) to try to close a bunch of them.

## Backlog

* [PRs and issues labelled with "triage review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/triage%20review)
  * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29638
  * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19550
  * https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30361
* [Open PRs - ](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls)- aim to keep below 150
* [Open PRs from first-time contributors](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/5) 
* [Inactive PRs](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/6)
