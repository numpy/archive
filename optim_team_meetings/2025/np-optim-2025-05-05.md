## PRs and issues labelled with "SIMD"
- Highway wrapper: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28622
    - Decision? Couple of other PR's depend on this decision
    - #define NPY_SIMDX (HWY_TARGET != HWY_SCALAR) will always be True as Highway is going to default EMU128 which will allow for compiler auto-vectorisation by default. Therefore NPY_SIMDX is likely unnecessary?
    - Highway is happy to host the wrapper to remove lane tags under `contrib` given it's fairly clear why it exists and why it's useful, which would save us hosting it in NumPy. We should contribute it directly under `contrib` for Highway which equally allows for it to evolve further if necessary?

- openmp PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28619 
    - Discussed different thread pools
        - Highway could provide centralised thread pool for use with SIMD Sort / OpenBLAS
    - No issue having an option for OpenMP but sad it's not the default

- OpenSVML, Generic SIMD Math routines
    - Naming
        - numpy-simd-routines ?
    - Python testing
    - Generic across languages
    - solya to generate and validate coefficients
        - Maybe coremath alternative?
    - Where to do:
        1. Inside of Highway
        2. Outside of NumPy in a separate repo
        3. Inside of NumPy with split headers


## Previous topics 

- Sayed: Improve highway usage and testing:
    - Cleaner interface to use Highway by getting rid of tags (applicable to https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28490)
    - for `ConvertTo`, use lane types as the 'tag'. For all other docs, assume/use `ScalableTag<T>` as the tag. 
    - Test suite to test each intrinsic to simplify debugging 
- Current Highway sources: Ability to toggle Highway on/off while building: Sayed to submit a PR fixing it. 
- argsort using Highway on ASIMD: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28416: not ideal, we prefer to have argsort natively implemented in Highway

- LASX loongArch support: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/28373
    - Adding 128 bit LAX in highway: WIP 
    - About 256 bit LASX?
    - CI doesnt work yet for these target


- Convert fp arithmetic from C to C++ using HWY: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27402
    -    segfaults. Recommended asan/hwasan. Also important to split loops into main and a single iteration for the remainder, and only call LoadN in the remainder.
    -    Sayed says it regresses on x86 when divisor is scalar (6x on AVX2)
    -    Port VSX specific code to highway to benefit all platforms - helps with type conversions, even for platforms that lack native division (all except VSX and SVE)

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions
    
- Can we switch to clang-cl for Windows? (Drop-in compatible with MSVC?)

- How to deal with dynamic dispatch in NumPy for future patches
    - HWY_ targets in NumPy: maybe disable SVE. AVX2 is fine. SSE4=SSE4.2+AES+CLMUL, not 4.1.
    - Highway Dynamic Dispatch
    - https://github.com/google/highway/issues/2364
    - Parked waiting for Raghuveer
    - Hard to decide whether or not to integrate with every project
        - Can we control it using Highway?
        - Inline SLEEF functions can be wrapped by `#ifdef HWY_TARGET` and guard with the no-multiple-inclusion Highway macros
    - Sayed has a side project going into upstream Meson for CPU features
        - Can it detect Highway features and match the C++ flags?
            - For functions targeting Highway we want to use Highway groups
            - Highway can change older groups
        - no longer define cpu features

- Discussed converting `exp` and `log` to Highway
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/numpy/_core/src/umath/loops_exponent_log.dispatch.c.src

- NEP 54 decision: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26949. Add a "we decided to go with Highway for static dispatch, see xxx" and mark the NEP as accepted. 
    - Dynamic dispatch: second step. The `meson_cpu` code may not be easy to understand, but less magical than Highway's self-including headers. Neither option is ideal.


## New topics


## Action items
- [name=r-devulap] to raise an issue for dispatch decision to gather all of the points together as well as whether to move to Google Highway

- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?


## Backlog
* (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20SIMD) (please add)

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML. Chris: would be good to get f16 and bf16 operands for MatMul; BLAS only supports f32 and f64.

- Leveraging more of Highway's pre-built functions
    - Dot / Matvec for none-f32/f64? 8..32-bit MatMul is currently in gemma.cpp.
