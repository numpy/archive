## Topics

- Check in with Raghuveer on 12/01/2026
    - Decision on x86-simd-sort latest 02/02/2026

- New PRs in NumPy SIMD Routines - @Mousius to look at 7 as priority!
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-simd-routines/pull/5
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-simd-routines/pull/7 <-- Priority!
- New PR for integrating sin/cos from NumPy SIMD Routines
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29699 <-- Investigate after above 7 merged
    - @Mousius to investigate performance on c7g/c8g machines
- Migration from x86-simd-sort to Google Highway VQSort
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/29710
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/29829
    - https://github.com/google/highway/pull/2737

- Bringing C++17 to Highway
    - Jan generally supportive
    - This *should* improve compile times, remove the need for tags and remove wrapper from NumPy
    - Waiting until we've landed sort in C++17

## PRs and issues labelled with "SIMD"


## Previous topics 

- NumPy SIMD Routines
    - Re-implementation of SVML in Google Highway
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-simd-routines
        - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-simd-routines/pull/1
        - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-simd-routines/pull/4

- Alternative to disabling attributes if ONLY_STATIC: will add new disable macro
- Add usage of C++17 in Highway, no user expressed concern yet
- Hwy: welcome functions to precompute intDiv 3 vectors, and Div passing them as args
    - First see if broadcast is optimized out, if we have struct of 3 scalars

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions
    
- How to deal with dynamic dispatch in NumPy for future patches
    - HWY_ targets in NumPy: maybe disable SVE. AVX2 is fine. SSE4=SSE4.2+AES+CLMUL, not 4.1.
    - Highway Dynamic Dispatch
    - https://github.com/google/highway/issues/2364
    - Parked waiting for Raghuveer
    - Hard to decide whether or not to integrate with every project
        - Can we control it using Highway?
        - Inline SLEEF functions can be wrapped by `#ifdef HWY_TARGET` and guard with the no-multiple-inclusion Highway macros
    - Sayed has a side project going into upstream Meson for CPU features
        - Can it detect Highway features and match the C++ flags?
            - For functions targeting Highway we want to use Highway groups
            - Highway can change older groups
        - no longer define cpu features

- OpenSVML, Generic SIMD Math routines
    We have already landed the initial PRs, which also include `sin/cos` operations for both single and double precision.

- Convert fp arithmetic from C to C++ using HWY: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27402
    -    segfaults. Recommended asan/hwasan. Also important to split loops into main and a single iteration for the remainder, and only call LoadN in the remainder.
    -    Sayed says it regresses on x86 when divisor is scalar (6x on AVX2)
    -    Port VSX specific code to highway to benefit all platforms - helps with type conversions, even for platforms that lack native division (all except VSX and SVE)


## New topics
- [PR30210](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/30210) - ENH: einsum_sumprod.c.src to cpp in numpy.multiarray see #29528
    - Need's to be updated to meet [NEP54](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0054-simd-cpp-highway.html) SIMD implementation due to lack of google highway use.
    - Avoid using the SIMD Class
## Action items
- [name=r-devulap] to raise an issue for dispatch decision to gather all of the points together as well as whether to move to Google Highway

- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?


## Backlog
* (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20SIMD) (please add)

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML. Chris: would be good to get f16 and bf16 operands for MatMul; BLAS only supports f32 and f64.

- Leveraging more of Highway's pre-built functions
    - Dot / Matvec for none-f32/f64? 8..32-bit MatMul is currently in gemma.cpp.
