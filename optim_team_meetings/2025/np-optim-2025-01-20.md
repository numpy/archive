**Code of Conduct**
The NumPy Steering Council has made a strong commitment to creating an open, inclusive, and positive community. 
All attendees of NumPy community events must adhere to the NumPy Code of Conduct (https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). 
If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.


**Present**: Jan, Sayed, Maanas, Ragesh, Abhishek, Chris

## PRs and issues labelled with "SIMD"

- Convert fp arithmetic from C to C++ using HWY: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/27402
    -    segfaults. Recommended asan/hwasan. Also important to split loops into main and a single iteration for the remainder, and only call LoadN in the remainder.
    -    Sayed says it regresses on x86 when divisor is scalar (6x on AVX2)
    -    Port VSX specific code to highway to benefit all platforms - helps with type conversions, even for platforms that lack native division (all except VSX and SVE)

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions
    
- Can we switch to clang-cl for Windows? (Drop-in compatible with MSVC?)

- How to deal with dynamic dispatch in NumPy for future patches
    - HWY_ targets in NumPy: maybe disable SVE. AVX2 is fine. SSE4=SSE4.2+AES+CLMUL, not 4.1.
    - Highway Dynamic Dispatch
    - https://github.com/google/highway/issues/2364
    - Parked waiting for Raghuveer
    - Hard to decide whether or not to integrate with every project
        - Can we control it using Highway?
        - Inline SLEEF functions can be wrapped by `#ifdef HWY_TARGET` and guard with the no-multiple-inclusion Highway macros
    - Sayed has a side project going into upstream Meson for CPU features
        - Can it detect Highway features and match the C++ flags?
            - For functions targeting Highway we want to use Highway groups
            - Highway can change older groups
        - no longer define cpu features

- Discussed converting `exp` and `log` to Highway
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/numpy/_core/src/umath/loops_exponent_log.dispatch.c.src

- NEP 54 decision: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/26949. Add a "we decided to go with Highway for static dispatch, see xxx" and mark the NEP as accepted. 
    - Dynamic dispatch: second step. The `meson_cpu` code may not be easy to understand, but less magical than Highway's self-including headers. Neither option is ideal.


## New topics


## Action items
- [name=r-devulap] to raise an issue for dispatch decision to gather all of the points together as well as whether to move to Google Highway

- Issue for testing unit for Highway to be able to develop kernels in Python. Raise issue in Highway to discuss. Short-term: can only implement the ops required by numpy, also allows prototyping numpy kernels. Mid-term goal could be to replace existing Highway tests. To be confirmed with other users: would it be OK to depend upon python?


## Backlog
* (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/component%3A%20SIMD) (please add)

- float16/bfloat16: should we have better support, e.g. as an external package providing bfloat16
  Raghuveer: not a short-term focus. Jan: bf16 quite useful for ML. Chris: would be good to get f16 and bf16 operands for MatMul; BLAS only supports f32 and f64.

- Leveraging more of Highway's pre-built functions
    - Dot / Matvec for none-f32/f64? 8..32-bit MatMul is currently in gemma.cpp.
