## Topics

- NumFOCUS subcommittee met last week to review the NumPy finances (Thomas Caswell, Melissa, Sebastian, Ralf).
    - A few issues found, NumFOCUS is working on addressing those.

- SciPy 2021 Sprint? (July 17-18)


- 2020 Community Survey results .pdf report is 99% ready.


- (Sebastian) I don't want to spend too much time on this, but if we agree on giving "weak python scalar promotion" a shot... how would we go about?  Right now I am operating under the assumption that this will  happen.  I assume any attempts are too late for the next release, but should we plan to just rip off the band-aid after branching and see where it takes us?
    - We will try this after the release (hopefully no revert will be necessary)

- Accessibility Discussion
  - Almost all issues in the theme, although e.g. alt-texts need fixing.
  - pydata-sphinx theme requires testing: https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/pull/294

- List of NumPy functions and frequency of use, as measured in other libraries (SciPy, Pandas, etc.): https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/python-api-inspect/blob/master/data/csv/numpy-summary-without-tests.csv
