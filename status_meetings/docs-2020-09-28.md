# Notes from 28 Sep '20

**Present:** Ralf Gommers, Melissa Mendonça, Ben Nathanson, Anne Bonner, Ryan Cooper, kubedoc

- Make sure the meetings are correctly scheduled for Zoom after today
- Is [this PR](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17024) still being worked on?
    - Closed; see [#17382](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17382) (Ben)
- Ben's How to "How to" has been merged :tada:
- Should we unify the looks of the generated docs and https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io?
- GSoD updates
    - @cooperrc: uploaded the first draft of [Moores Law linear regression](https://github.com/cooperrc/numpy-tutorials/blob/mooreslaw/content/mooreslaw-tutorial.ipynb)
    - kubedoc has a draft for a simple Deep Learning library with NumPy
- Establish a final authority on grammatical issues (Ben)
    - Settle, e.g., disputes over commas
![](https://i.imgur.com/IxbSnBn.png)
    - Suggest *Chicago Manual of Style*, latest edition (currently 17th), chapter 5,  "Grammar and Usage"
        - Comprehensive and respected
        - Drawback: Not everyone has one and it's costly ($70)
    - "Search path" for style issues:
        1. NumPy house style (*indices*, not *indexes*) (under construction)
        2. [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style/)
            - E.g. [Commas after introductory words and phrases](https://developers.google.com/style/commas?hl=en#commas-after-introductory-words-and-phrases)
        3. Chicago or other grammar reference
- Thoughts on reorganizing the Sphinx docs (Ben):
    - Discover overlaps, for instance:
        - [What is NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/whatisnumpy.html)
        - [About NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/about.html)

    - ...or...

        - [Setting up and using your development environment](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_environment.html)
        - [Development workflow](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_workflow.html)
        - [Development process - summary](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#development-process-summary)
        - [Building from source](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/building.html)
        - [Building the NumPy API and reference docs](https://numpy.org/devdocs/docs/howto_build_docs.html)
    - Great idea!
    - Notes from @rgommers, these diffs to reorganize are very large: 
        1. Keep PR for moving a document separate from PR to edit a document
        2. Open an issue to show revised organization before a PR 


- Doc PRs awaiting merge:  (Ben)
    - [new glossary (#16996)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17353)
    - [I/O how-to (#17353)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17353)
    - [link numpy.org install instructions to ImportError page (#360)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/pull/360)
    - [NumPy restyling for pydata theme (#17382)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17382)

- Linking Sphinx tutorials page to notebook tutorials (Ben)
    - Can we now link Sphinx pages to live (executable) notebooks?
    - Allow user a choice of links: live or rendered notebook
    - Remove linear algebra .rst?
    - Convert masked array .rst to notebook?

- Details on ["Reviewer guidelines"  (PR #17252)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17252) (Ben)
    - Motivation (commit checklist, tone..?)
    - Target audience (maintainers? everyone?)
