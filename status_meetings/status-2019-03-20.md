- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous meetings](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [NumPy at BIDS Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=YmVya2VsZXkuZWR1X2lla2dwaWdtMjMyamJobGRzZmIyYzJqODFjQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)

**Present:** Stefan, Matti, Tyler, Chuck, Hameer

## Follow-up from last meeting/discussions

- Report on the [random number generator refactor call](https://github.com/BIDS-numpy/docs/blob/master/meetings/2019-03-19_random-number-generator-refactor.md)
  - Not clear if it will be ready for 1.17 - Chuck is beginning to think about 1.17 release.
- Reminder of developer meeting, 10/11 May
- The number of open PRs is down near 240. Nice!!
    - Stéfan's one humble open PR (`constant` as default mode for padding) [got merged](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/4808); a straightforward follow-up to review would be [#11358](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11358)
- UArray: For overriding and duck-typing: https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/uarray

## Community Suggested Topics

- Do we want a release calendar for NumPy?
    - We could add aims for bigger scope features we'd like to have included in each.
    - S: Perhaps can live with the roadmap?
- Precision error on wheels as of late
    - Traced back to merging of FFT refactor
    - Shows up only on 32-bit, not on Windows [link](https://travis-ci.org/MacPython/numpy-wheels)
- Manylinux2010

    - Matthew's thought on timeline:

        > Maybe build the wheels when the image comes out, along with the manylinux1 wheels, and switch to building 2010 wheels only, in a year or so?

    - Images are not out yet; when they come out, 32-bit will initially not be supported

## Work status

Matti:
- Outreachy applicants are starting to appear
- Documentation is almost down to no warnings, due to a one-line [numpydocs fix](https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc/pull/201) and a [fix](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13119) for repeat c function definitions. The next step is to turn on `-WT --keep-going` to make sure commits that add new warnings fail.
- Started work on [merging randomgen](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13163), learned lots about git and [merging two unrelated repos](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13163/files#diff-e84dba42a7326dfd8f7cc3e8f2957551). Now getting the cython code to build.

Tyler:
  - reducing my open PRs: SciPy (1) & NumPy (7) based on feedback from last meeting; that said, I'm not a big fan of this---this may have already reduced visibility of potentially useful work for which reviewer bandwidth simply isn't there; one of my closures was already re-opened
  - DevOps efforts
    - SciPy
      - ([merged](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/9940)) removed extraneous NumPy distutils copies from SciPy Azure CI
      - ([merged](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/9774)) Azure CI OpenBLAS versions now **finally** match scipy-wheels. The trick was to match mingw64 versions more closely with the wheels workflow
    - NumPy
      - ([merged](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12457)) NumPy now uses wheels-matched OpenBLAS backend in MacOS CI testing (previously, **no** linear algebra backend was enabled)
      - ([open](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12790)) Thanks to the above addition of MacOS OpenBLAS usage, all 3 platforms under test on Azure CI now have compile-time & post-mortem OpenBLAS version availability in PR 12790
  - Fixing Bugs
    - NumPy 
      - ([open](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13061)) Working to address reviewer comments to prohibit certain undesirable integer casting operations that run through `timedelta64` casts, but this will probably require some decisions about issuing warnings and what will effect on i.e., pandas be?
