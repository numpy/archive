# Agenda

1. Status of the `newsite` branch.
2. Status of content creation.
3. Status of translations with Crowdin.



# Meeting Minutes
**1. Website Prototype**
</br>Since the selected Hugo template requires considerable customization to serve the needs of numpy.org, it would be helpful to have a few page prototypes designed to help the team visualize better the final result.
</br>We will start with index.html.

**2. Content**
</br> *Index.html*
What NumPy code should go on the Home page? Let’s invite the NumPy community to contribute to this decision.

*Learn.md* is ready.

*FAQ section* Let’s try to create purposeful information instead of resorting to an FAQ.

Shaloo is working on more content.


**3. NumPy Sprint at BIDS Nov, 22-23, 2019**
</br>GSoD and web teams are welcome. 

**4. Cross Platform and Browser Testing**
