# NumPy Documentation Team meetings

- Time: 8am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at: https://zoom.us/j/420005230

# Notes from 6 Apr '20

**Present:** Melissa Mendonça, Dhavide Aruliah, Mars Lee, Warren Weckesser, Ralf Gommers, Guilherme Leobas, Tarcísio Fischer

## Topics

- We now have a [Project on github](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/2)
    - organized roadmap for the future
    - actionable tasks for people who join the team

- Updated from Melissa:
    - [PR: How to help document NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15908): to be revised with ideas from [this comment by Ross](- https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14817)
    - [PR: numpy.ma tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15791)
    - IO with NumPy + Zarr (How To): in progress
    - Started writing proposal for Google Season of Docs: call opens on April 13 (deadline is May 4). Can [this issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14473) about last year's project be closed?

- High level docs issues:
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15793 (Irio)
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15792 (Irio)

- Small/quick issues:
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9502
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6387
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/5778

- Issues that require some experience:
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9476
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9193
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/9646
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/7035
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6025

- Larger doc proposals like [issue 15760 on array data storage](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760)
  - That issue is missing what data should be used (e.g. dataset X, using floats, structured data and object arrays)
  - Melissa is writing a template or list of questions/topics that should be answered

- Tarcisio: would be useful to have a better explanation of the memory model to get a deeper understanding.

- Dhavide: have an example of C vs Fortran order

- Starting a separate Jupyter notebook tutorials repo
  - https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials
  - Store as Jupytext or notebooks with output stripped?
  - Matplotlib has notebook downloads --> that is Sphinx-gallery. TODO: look back at SciPy thread on this, why wasn't sphinx-gallery sufficient?
  - Can decide later how to publish. The important part is to get high-quality content. Could publish as standalone repo, convert to reST, or ... (people struggle with reST, it makes the contribution process too hard)
  - See, for example, [this issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/14690)
  - Check out reviewnb

- Datasets package for tutorials
    - Intake catalog
    - Melissa will look into downloader (Pooch?)
    - Find a name:) `pydatasets`?

- Codesprite tutorials: update?
    - Starting my own Numpy journey, starting with Anne Bonner's [Absolute Beginners Guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html)
    - Do you guys prefer people to start using NumPy on JupyterNotebook, their command line, .py file in their code editor (VSCode), IDEs PyCharm, Spyder?
        - Depends on person's starting point. MathLab, Javascript, Python, R, new to numerical computing
    - Target audience: some familiarity with Python. If no experience, direct them to an external beginners to learn Python
    - Idea for first comic: The map before the map- I know X, how I start using Numpy?
        - Flowchart
    - Idea for second comic: Now assuming some familiarity with Python, let's continue with JupyterNotebooks...

- Website: update? (will be open for translations soon?)
    - not yet ready for translations

- Warren might work on something for ufuncs/gufuncs
