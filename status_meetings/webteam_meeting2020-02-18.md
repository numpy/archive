# Meeting Minutes

## 1. Content
[**Issue #81**](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/81) Create a copy for the shell, possibly include a link to a tutorial.

**Content of the homepage** *Ralf:* Review and try to make it less text-dense:
- “interoperability” tile
- tabs content
- case studies (?)


## 2. NumPy.org (Hugo generated)
**Interactive shell** It has some hiccups, may crash if we release it. Discussion with Chris was about a redesign, which is a longer-term thing. Inessa has connection issues with it. Open an issue on it for now, see if we can figure it out. If so, let's release and deal with load issues if and when they occur.


**UI of the homepage** *Joe:* Review the shell styling, e.g. whitespace.

**"DOWNLOAD" button on the homepage** Change it to "GET STARTED".



**MailChimp integration**
*Inessa:* Open a MailChimp account on behalf of the NumPy team, share the account info with the core team, provide API key to Joe.
 

**Red italics and typeset code** It's in UIkit, easy to fix. The italics should be black, for code the suggestion is dark blue.

**Footer** 
- "Trademark" should be removed as a footer link
- Check all links

**Languages dropdown** Not all the pages have it, open an issue.


**Report from Mars**
- added case studies styling
- next: Cross platform and browser testing for Hugo generated pages

## 3. Rollout plan

**Tentative release date:** March, 15th

**Touch base:** March, 6-7th
