# Notes from 12 Oct '20

**Present:** Melissa Mendonça, Ben Nathanson, kubedoc, Abbas H, Ryan Cooper, Matti Picus, Anne Bonner, Ross Barnowski

- GSoD check:
    - Ryan: 
        - [Moore's Law tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/31)
            - Initially meant to be an IO tutorial, this has morphed into a "scientific workflow" tutorial. Ryan plans working on a shorter/simpler IO tutorial as well.
    - kubedoc
        - [Deep learning from scratch tutorial](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/pull/33)
            - Ben and Melissa suggest doing a first round of review/suggestions before doing any more changes
            - Anne mentions being mindful of the size of visualizations if they are added to the document. Melissa mentions since this will be hosted in the numpy-tutorials repo, we can be less strict about the visualization sizes.

- Linking Sphinx to notebook tutorials and vice versa (Ben)
    - Can we now link Sphinx pages to tutorial notebooks? To headings within the notebooks?
    - Should the link be to a live or rendered page, or  include a link to each, or it depends?
    - Remove the .rst tutorials?
    - Melissa might have a solution using github actions; Ross offers to also do it via myst-nb. We'll set up the rendered html notebooks and decide on styling/css possibilities later.
    - Ryan asks about linking to the NumPy docs in the notebooks: the best right now is to use the links to the documentation in numpy.org/doc/stable


- Turn [Quickstart](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html) into Jupyter notebooks (Ben)
    - A Sphinx [intro page](https://github.com/bjnath/numpy-1/blob/intro-page/doc/source/user/introducing.rst) (merging the current [What is NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/whatisnumpy.html) and [Quickstart](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html)) highlights NumPy features. Each highlight is a short explanation, followed by two links: *Learn more* and *Try it out*.
    - Each *Try it out* links to a notebook.
        - Each notebook is small and dedicated to that highight.
    - *Learn more* links to a reference page or a section in [Basics](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.html).
    - Takes a chunk out of our overlapping-content problem
    - We discussed reorganizing the quickstart and other user guide/reference guides. Ben will consider opening an issue with a plan for that. Ross mentions we should be mindful that the user guide is very similar to Travis' original book, and users might rely on those pages/links for content. It might be necessary to consider first what should be kept in the user guide (or a differently named document that acts as the current user guide PDF). The sections "NumPy basics" and "NumPy C-API" are mostly based on Travis' book.

- We talked about maybe meeting weekly; Melissa will prompt the #docs channel on slack so we can find a time for next week.

For next meeting:

- Remove most of the general git tutorial pages (not related to NumPy) in `dev/gitwash` (Ben)
    - Out of date
    - Out of scope
    - Too much to maintain

- Clarify rebase instructions in [Development workflow](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/dev/development_workflow.html#rebasing-on-master) (Ben)
    - Unclear what situation requires a rebase
    - Poor instructions on handling conflicts
    - Has sent me over a cliff more than once
    - I'd fix it if I knew the answers

- GitHub [project page for docs](https://github.com/orgs/numpy/projects/): Bury it or revive it? (Ben)

- Clarify goals of [Reviewer guidelines (PR #17252)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17252) (Ben)
    - Motivation (what is it intended to fix/avoid?)
    - Target audience (maintainers? everyone?)
