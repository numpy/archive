    - Post PR to tutorial repo

- New [write-up](https://bjnath.github.io/demodocs/new_docs_dev) on building docs. Needs work. (Ben)
    - Ben will take a look at the current page: https://numpy.org/devdocs/docs/howto_build_docs.html and see if the best strategy is to improve on that or write a new page 
- Proposed doc [landing page](https://bjnath.github.io/demodocs/top_docs_page). (For comparisons, [current page](https://numpy.org/devdocs), [home page](https://numpy.org).) (Ben)
    - Larger discussion, but some links can already be removed because they are already present in numpy.org's navbar
    - Wait for accepted Season of Docs proposals, since they might cover similar ideas
    - Mrinal points out his proposal for the restructuring into experience levels. We discussed opening issues like 15760 (linked below) to organize missing content
- How to generate how-tos? (Ben)
    - https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15760 is a potential templates requesting content

    - Ben suggests taking a look at stack overflow and see what confuses people
- Thoughts on improving NumPy glossary (Ben)
- Style guide for NumPy topics (Ben)
- SciPy Cookbook update (Ben)
- [numpy-tutorials](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials) is close to ready. 

  - Ross's rendering is ready, with Binder and download links. Should be ready soon. 
  - Open questions on whether to merge into main repo. Melissa points out that an outside repo has less baggage for building. 
  - Matti asks how it will be hosted (partially addressed in [issue 10](https://github.com/numpy/numpy-tutorials/issues/10))

- Timeline on new Sphinx theme? (Ben)
