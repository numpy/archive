# 2020-03-04 NumPy Community Meeting

Note: we now alternate between [triage meetings](https://hackmd.io/68i_JvOYQfy9ERiHgXMPvg) and community meetings.

- Time: 11am Pacific Time
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Trello workboard](https://trello.com/b/Azg4fYZH/numpy-at-bids)
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** Matti, Warren, Ross, Stéfan, Inessa, Rakesh Vasudeva, Melissa, Sebastian, Ralf, Chuck


## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Update on NumPy paper
  - Sent out for review

- [Tensor Developer Summit website](https://xd-con.org/tensor-2020/)
  - For now, decided to continue despite concerns of Coronavirus; most of our travelers are from nearby
  - Make steps to accommodate those who do not wish to fly in

- Website release plan
    - March 15th launch! (Et tu, NumPy)
    - CloudFlare in front of GitHub pages
    - Community input would be appreciated on the two completed case studies
    - NumPy newsletter - input/ideas welcome. Coordinating issue in repo shortly

- Survey update/plan
  - Discuss feedback from survey dry run
    * Take the survey: https://umdsurvey.umd.edu/jfe/form/SV_8bJrXjbhXf7saAl
    * Provide your feedback: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12dt4PH2vfvb8KdqaizlhhWrUdmkE3BasLH4z-wgXwrg/edit?usp=sharing

- Documentation and a numpy.org/doc/latest link
  - We should have a `stable` label that points to the last release, and `latest` points to HEAD.
  - Ross will try it with Stéfan's help.

- Would appreciate help pushing [scipy sphinx theme v2](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-sphinx-theme-v2) over the line
  - There are [27 open issues](https://github.com/scipy/scipy-sphinx-theme-v2/issues)


## Topics

- Deprecate dtype creation like ``np.dtype(np.integer)``, creating concrete dtype from abstract dtype class [PR 15534](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/15534)
  - go for it. If anything it may expose bugs.


- NEP 37:
  - Add to the NEP: A global Opt-In flag (how do we design that)
    - May it be preferable if libraries do not have their own setting?
  - Is the restricted namespace/API versioning really important?
    - Probably yes, but we don't have the bandwidth to work it out.
    - NEP 37 can be implemented outside of NumPy today (without changes to the namespace size), so we can experiment with it. 
  - What seems missing from the current proposal?
  - Sklearn will use a context manager, that seems fine or not?
    - Probably not, it's from an end user perspective quite clumsy if every package has a similar global flag and the user needs to enable/disable multiple of those.
    - Libraries probably should not be setting global state, if the NEP ends up creating one.


- (Deprecate ``np.promote_types(number, string)``?)
  - Discussion: We will probably go ahead and deprecate in the long run.
  - Alternative: Promote to object
  - Will get stranger once we have have ufuncs (not impossible)
  - pandas test probably have only a single failure if we do this (although the code change is a bit trickier to avoid false positives in ufuncs)
  - right now `np.promote_types(np.int16, 'S')` produces `'S6'`. `np.promote_types(np.int32, 'S')` -> `S11`

 - Welcome Rakesh!
   * What components of NumPy might be a good place to focus initial attention?
     - Don't touch distutils (limited testing, very system-dependent)
     - f2py *was* lacking attention, but @melissawm has improved the situation
     - [SIMD](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13516)
   * Accelerate on MacOS

 - Docs discussion [NEP 44](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0044-restructuring-numpy-docs.html)
   * Next release ~July
   * SVD tutorial is live - more to come

## Additional Details

- Matti
  - working on multibuild, created a new org and [repo](https://github.com/multi-build/docker-images) and [github user](https://github.com/multibuilder/) to build xenial testing images and upload them to [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/multibuild/repositories)
  - Still looking for test failures and segfaults on linux32, hoping the move to test on xenial docker image will help.

- Warren

  - Work on a faster text reader is on github at [readtextstream](https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/readtextstream).

- Sebastian
  * Dask Meeting travels, some NEP revisal
  * look at get array module.

- Ross
  * Some notes related to the update of [`np.polynomial`/`poly1d`](https://hackmd.io/1CUvnChwQmmpqrvmIbKDsA)
