## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Possible GSoD project? Or small development grant? It could  be nice to have someone dedicated to finishing the Doxygen integration and updating the C docs. Ref: [DOC: Questions Regarding C-API Documentation Status and Maintenance](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27576)

- Also maybe a Contributor comics season 3 with GSoD. Revisit budget this year.

- A contributor has approached to make a French translation of the comics.


## New topics

- [PDF docs added for latest release](https://github.com/numpy/doc/pull/29) - Thanks, Melissa!
    - Any interest in automating the process is welcome.

- [Scientific Python Translations sprint](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/thread/6LN5F2M7TCIKKA346KV4EN6Q6I627YG2/)
