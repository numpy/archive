## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- Possible GSoD project? Or small development grant? It could  be nice to have someone dedicated to finishing the Doxygen integration and updating the C docs. Ref: [DOC: Questions Regarding C-API Documentation Status and Maintenance](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27576)

- Also maybe a Contributor comics season 3 with GSoD. Revisit budget this year.
    - No annoucement from GSOD yet. GSOD for the year is usually annouced early Feb
    - Could go for another grant if GSOD doesn't work out

- A contributor has approached to make a French translation of the comics.
    - Mars has sent a message back to the contributor


## New topics

- [PDF docs added for latest release](https://github.com/numpy/doc/pull/29) - Thanks, Melissa!
    - Any interest in automating the process is welcome.

- [Scientific Python Translations sprint](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/numpy-discussion@python.org/thread/6LN5F2M7TCIKKA346KV4EN6Q6I627YG2/)
    - Tool for translations: https://crowdin.com/
    - File type for translation .po, .pot, could be used with graphic software to automatically update the text
        - With po. or .pot file
        - However, probably too much work upfront whent the current scale is rather small (2 lanaguges)
