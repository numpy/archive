    - Tectonic https://github.com/tectonic-typesetting/tectonic
    - Maybe automate the release docs?
- [name=Melissa] NumPy codebase docs [issue #27926](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27926)
    - Maybe related to https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27966

- Doxygen + Breathe: Do we need it anymore? https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27610
    - Find out places where Doxygen is still used and original motivation for adding it.
    - How are C++ docstrings rendered if at all?


## New topics

- Possible GSoD project? Or small development grant? It could  be nice to have someone dedicated to finishing the Doxygen integration and updating the C docs. Ref: [DOC: Questions Regarding C-API Documentation Status and Maintenance](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27576)

- Also maybe a Contributor comics season 3 with GSoD. Revisit budget this year.

- A contributor has approached to make a French translation of the comics.
