### Code of Conduct

We want to take a moment to remind you that this meeting is meant to be welcoming and inclusive. It's important for us to have a healthy community. Like all NumPy spaces, and everyone participating in them, this meeting will follow our [Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/). If you haven't read it yet, please take some time to do so later on as it already applies to you. For now, in short, please be kind and generous towards one another. 

If you see violations, take a screenshot, intervene in a respectful manner, and report it to the CoC Committee via email. For more information, refer to the Reporting Guidelines section on https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct/.

## Follow-up from last meeting / discussions

- [name=rossbar] Dealing with data for NumPy tutorials
  * Currently running a mirror (from my personal github account) containing data for numpy tutorials.
    - At the very least, this should move outside of my personal github account
    - Look into S3 buckets?
    - Talk to Numfocus about allocating a bucket
    - vs Github repo, small, just a few MB
        - But could be limiting if have a future tutorial that needs more eg NLP
  * Data as a submodule?
    - Doesn't scale to large datasets, but probably more convenient than what we currently do
    - Similar to what SciPy is implementing (scikit-learn does something similar)
        - [Initial setup for scipy.datasets](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/15607)
        - Each dataset is a repo under the scipy organization. For example, https://github.com/scipy/dataset-ascent
        - [Documentation on scipy.datasets](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/reference/datasets.html)
        
     - **Action Item** rossbar will bring this up at community meeting, ask for someone w/ permissions to make a `numpy-tutorials-data` repo in the numpy org
         - Discussed at the meeting - no objections for a new repo
         - Possible pitfall - people start using the repo as a general source for the MNIST dataset. If this happens we can abandon the repo. 
     - **New action item**
       * Still bring up at next community meeting (mea culpa for missing the last one)
       * Ping Matti/Sebastian/someone with priviledges to open repos in numpy org
     - **Scikit-learn has mnist in their datasets repo**: consider relying on this instead
     

- [name=Mukulika ]Interest for participating in Google Season of Docs 2023
    - **Due Date:** March 24th
    - The new season has been [announced](https://groups.google.com/g/season-of-docs-announce/c/-wfcYZ9UYwc/m/gotnfJ0OCgAJ?pli=1).
    - Read about last season's successful projects [here](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/2022/participants).
    - Mukulika, Melissa, Ross available for mentoring
  * Dates: Open 2/15, close in March
  * Bring up at community meeting
    - Hackmd w/ ideas to mailing list (https://hackmd.io/8KTav_wLRY6hc6h-T8_1dA)
    - Seek out mentors
    - Figure out how it works admin-wise. Do we go through numfocus?
    - Ask NumFOCUS to help with pay or contracts for GSoD
    - Discussed at community meeting: infrastucture is set up
    - Submitted form for [NumPy Contributor Journey Comics](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2023:-Project-Proposal)
    - Results on 31st March 6 PM UTC
    - Guide for technical writers: https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide
    - Mars writing the [statement of interest](https://hackmd.io/g20oAnAqSUi3b8YgUOTBuQ?edit)
        - Where to formally submit?
        - By May 10

- Add to new document ideas:
    - Understanding NumPy striding while doing a transpose
        - We can use the xray dataset for the illustration
    - Best practices for random number generators for parallelization
    - A guide for common performance issue questions
        - Could be a Sphinx gallery for better discoverabilty
