### MEETING NOTES
- Ronald van Elburg: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23889 needs review
- Kai: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/23762 needs review
- Kai: How to begin adding a new function (`np.matrix_transpose`) to NumPy?
- Kai: Looking at moving `busday` function from numpy/numpy to numpy/numpy-financial. This will require moving some C code.  Question: How do I know what's in the public C-API, and what's internal to NumPy?
