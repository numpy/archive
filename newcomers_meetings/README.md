**Post-event survey**

To assess how well we are doing with onboarding newcomers to the NumPy contributor community at this event and to keep improving our onboarding practices, we’ve introduced a post-event survey. 
Respondents may choose to include their email address and name in the last question of the survey if they wish for a NumPy Contributor Experience team representative to follow up on their feedback. Otherwise, this feedback is submitted anonymously. The collected feedback shall not be shared with any organizations or individuals outside of the NumPy Contributor Experience team without the prior respondent’s written permission.
